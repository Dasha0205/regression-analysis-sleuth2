# Regression Analysis Project â€“ Sleuth2 Dataset

This repository contains a university semester project focused on exploring the relationship between a selected response variable and multiple predictors using a dataset from the `Sleuth2` package in R.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The analysis includes the following tasks:

1. **Descriptive Statistics:**  
   Summary of the dataset and visual exploration of key variables.

2. **Simple Linear Regression:**  
   Analysis of the response variable's dependence on one numeric predictor.

3. **ANOVA with Categorical Regressor:**  
   Evaluation of the effect of a categorical variable on the response.

4. **Multiple Regression with Interaction:**  
   Model including both numeric and categorical variables plus their interaction.

5. **Model Selection and Refinement:**  
   Building a final model with relevant predictors based on statistical significance.

6. **Assumption Checking:**  
   Testing model assumptions using diagnostic tools and statistical tests.
